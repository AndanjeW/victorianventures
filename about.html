  <h1>Our Story  </h1>
  <p>Victorian ventures limited was born out of a passion for food. Our founders began their journey in the hospitality industry and gradually transitioned to the agricultural sector and finally to the food processing industry. 
    Throughout this journey, the desire to empower our community of small scale farmers grew. 
    This desire was fueled by a need to curtail the post-harvest losses suffered by the farmers in our community. 
    Victorian Ventures embodies the production of high quality food products with great consideration for the environment 
    while uplifting our community of farmers. We are guided in this endeavor by our three WHY’s.

  </p>

  <div class="row reasons">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h5>Environmental Stewardship </h5>
      <p> At Victorian Ventures, we are committed to practicing circular agriculture, an approach that minimizes the use of external inputs, closes nutrient loops, and regenerates soils. We achieve this through striving to use natural methods of pest control, we have embraced composting and vermicomposting as well as water conserving forms of irrigation such as drip irrigation.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h5>Sustainable Productivity </h5>
      <p> Owing to our commitment to sustainable productivity,
         we understand the importance of curtailing and reversing 
         effects of land degradation to ensure a productive and 
          agricultural system that preserves and protects our 
           and nonrenewable resources.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="community-empowerment"> 

      <h5>Community Empowerment </h5>
      <p> <em> For small scale farmers, massive produce is lost through post-harvest handling. The loss occurs at the farm level, in transit to the market, as well as in the market. Horticultural crops being highly perishable cannot be stored in their form to sell later. They are also highly seasonal leading to frequent market bursts.

        Post-harvest losses translate to reduced income for the players in agricultural sector, especially for the small holder farmers, leading to increased levels of desperation in rural farming communities.
        
        As a result of loss of income, we have poor health and wellbeing, poverty and hunger, stress and depression being so rampant in the rural areas leading to widespread insecurity. These problems have led to below par economies and unhealthy coping mechanisms like alcoholism, gambling, drug abuse and dependency.
        
        Secondly, we have dumpsites all over the country, especially around markets due to unsold perishable produce left behind by desperate farmers. These sites are a health risk as they harbor pests and diseases. They are air pollutants due to the pungent smells they produce as they decay, and they are also an eyesore to people around them. This is where Victorian Ventures Limited offers a solution to farmers and the community at large through value addition and farmer education to offset the excess produce that goes to waste due to low demand or overproduction. 
        
        We incorporate various methods and techniques to enhance farm produce's quality, marketability, and profitability to curb this menace. By doing so we provide an all year round ready market for our farmers hence positively impacting lives.</p>
